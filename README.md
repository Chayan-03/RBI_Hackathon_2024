# HaRBInger 2024 Hackathon - Team README

## Introduction

Welcome to our team's submission for HaRBInger 2024, the Reserve Bank of India's Third Global Hackathon. This event brings together innovators from across the globe to develop cutting-edge solutions to pressing challenges in the financial sector. We are excited to present our approach to tackling the problem statements under the themes of "Zero Financial Frauds" and "Being Divyang Friendly".

## About HaRBInger 2024

HaRBInger 2024 focuses on two key themes:

1. **Zero Financial Frauds**
   - Real-time prediction, detection, and prevention of frauds in financial transactions.
   - Ensuring transaction anonymity in token-based (CBDC) transactions.
   - Identifying mule bank accounts/payment wallets.

2. **Being Divyang Friendly**
   - Accurately identifying banknotes by visually impaired individuals.

These themes underscore India's commitment to fostering innovation, inclusivity, trust, and confidence in the digital finance landscape. As digital payments evolve, so do the methods of fraud, making it crucial to develop sophisticated detection and prevention techniques. Simultaneously, enhancing financial accessibility for visually impaired individuals remains a priority.

## Our Commitment

Our team is dedicated to addressing these critical issues with innovative, technology-driven solutions. We are leveraging advanced AI/ML, data analytics, and cutting-edge technologies to build robust systems that not only detect and prevent fraud but also ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all users.

### Why This Matters

- **Financial Fraud:** With the rise of real-time payments, the potential for fraud has increased. Immediate intervention and sophisticated detection methods are essential to protect consumers and the financial system.
- **Inclusivity:** Ensuring that visually impaired individuals can confidently navigate the financial landscape is a vital step toward a more inclusive society. Our solutions aim to empower these individuals with the tools they need to manage their finances independently.

## Our Approach

Our approach is rooted in understanding the nuances of each problem statement and developing comprehensive, user-friendly solutions. We believe that technology can bridge gaps and create a safer, more inclusive financial ecosystem.
